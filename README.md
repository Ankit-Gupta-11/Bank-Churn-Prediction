## About the Project <a id = "1"></a>


<p align = "justify">
The process involves applying for a credit card, getting approved, meeting a minimum spend within a set amount of time, earning a large welcome bonus, and canceling the card before the next annual fee is due. Once this is complete, the process is simply repeated again and again, hence the term churning. In this project using a dataset related to bank churn I predicted the churn.
